      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:

      <description>Loudon County is part of the northern Virginia region. Along with Loudon County, NOVA also consists of:
The NoVA area is composed by:
City of AlexandriaArlington CountyCity of FairfaxFairfax countyCity of Falls ChurchFauquier CountyLoudoun CountyCity of ManassasCity of Manassas ParkPrince William CountyRecognizing that food insecurity is not bound by county or city, we constructed social and economic vulnerability indices for NOVA at the census tract levels.</description>

      <description>Food insecurity may also be affected by food accessibility. Those with access to high quality food outlets were less likely to be food insecure (Mayer, Hillier, Bachhuber and Long, 2014). We measured food access in the Loudon County and northern Virginia area using three indicators. These indicators correspond to traditional food retailers, farmers’ markets, and food pantries. Unlike traditional food retailers and farmers’ markets, food pantries usually provide food to vulnerable populations for free or at especially discounted prices.</description>

      <description>Project goalsThe goal of this project was to identify areas in Loudon County and northern Virginia where a potential Loudon County food hub could alleviate food insecurity. As we have shown in the preceding sections, there are many variables related to food security and these variables are often correlated with one another. In this final section, we construct a single composite index variable for food insecurity which can be used to identify food insecure areas.</description>

      <description>Data and Methodology Matson and Thayer (2014) note that food hubs can decrease food insecurity. In assessing the potential for a Loudon County food hub to address such issues, we first identified food insecure areas in the Loudon County region. We used two primary data sources for this project. To develop index variables of food insecurity, we obtained underlying variables on food supply and demand in Loudon County and the northern Virginia region.</description>

      <description>2020 Loudoun County Project We partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension to assess the potential for a Loudon County food hub to alleviate food insecurity in northern Virginia and provide a sales outlet for local agricultural products.
Project Goals Our project goal was to create a composite index measuring food insecurity in Loudon County and northern Virginia to identify areas where a food hub could improve food and nutrition outcomes.
Project Approach Our research team used an interdisciplinary approach to combine datasets of publicly available economic and social information related to food insecurity.</description>

      <description>Data Science for the Public Good ProgramThe Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/social-decision-analytics/dspg-program) is a summer immersive program held at the Biocomplexity Institute’s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today.</description>
