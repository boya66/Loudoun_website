      <description>Project goalsThe goal of this project was to identify areas in Loudon County and northern Virginia where a potential Loudon County food hub could alleviate food insecurity. As we have shown in the preceding sections, there are many variables related to food security and these variables are often correlated with one another. In this final section, we construct a single composite index variable for food insecurity which can be used to identify food insecure areas.</description>
